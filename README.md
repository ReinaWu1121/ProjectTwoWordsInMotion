## Overview

Community is the foundation of society, yet as humanity continues to face challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people are losing this sense of community that they once held close. This project depicts feelings loneliness and internal struggles felt by many as they lack a sense of belongingness in this continuosly isolated world. The lyrics of the song, "Come Back to Earth" by Mac Miller, are uniquely presented within a collection of website pages that draws attention to the meaning of the words while also displayed in a visually engaging method.

## Technical Details

Depictions of loneliness can be seen through minimalistic elements utilized throughout the composition. The blue gradient background, creates an underwater effect that simulates the hopelessness the lyrics exemplifies. This is further supported through transitions such as fading and floating, creating the effect that the text is submerged beneath the ocean. However, elements of hope are also presented within the composition, primarily from the faint glow of the white text, symbolizing that there is still light amongst all the darkness. Color changes is also another strong theme throughout the project, with changes in color of certain words to the entire page meaning to evoke the complexity and range of human emotions. Lastly, movement is essential to this project, ranging from slow scaling and rotations to erratic motions and growth, each animation serves a distinct purpose in ensuring that the word being manipulated receive its deserving emphasis.
